        <p><strong>ReadingðŸ“š</strong><br>
          As Richard Steele has rightly said "Reading is to mind what exercise is to the body",
          reading rejuvinates our spirits and fills our hearts with joy.I am a book lover and I think book reading
          is one of the best hobbies a person can have.<br><strong> I am Malala</strong> by Malala Yousafzai,<strong> Wings of Fire </strong>an autobiography
          by APJ Abdul Kalam, <strong>Elon Musk</strong> by Ashlee Vance are some of my favourite books.</p>

        <p><strong>Listening MusicðŸŽµ</strong><br>
          "Music speaks what cannot
          be expressed,soothes the mind and gives it a rest,heals the heart and makes it whole". I love to listen to diffrent
          kinds of music from classical to pop. I have developed a music website,<mark>PlayBeats</mark> wich offers a vast assortment
          of music for music lovers.<br>
